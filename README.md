## What is this?

This is a script to make writing books in Minecraft easier.

And it supports CJK characters.

## Usage

Just paste your text in the "text.txt" and open a "Book and Quill" in Minecraft.

```python
python main.py
```

And then you can see a countdown, please get back to Minecraft before the countdown ends.

```

1
Begin!
```

Then the program will automatically read the text file and paste to your book, and it can also change the page.

## Compatibility

Only tested on Windows, and it may only support Windows I think.

A Minecraft book in Java Edition can write up to 100 pages long, but the exact number of characters you can write in one page depends on the sum width of the whole text, so I used the averge number `255`(according to the Chinese Minecraft Wiki from Fandom), you can change it to the number you want if you are sure it will not go wrong.

You may **not** paste too much text into the txt file, because there is an up limit in Minecraft. The example I gave is bad, it is the original version of *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, it has more than 1,000,000 Chinese characters, you may change it to something shorter.
